	  <h3>1. Course Description</h3>
	  <p>Machine learning studies the question: “how can we build adaptive algorithms 
	  	 that automatically improve their performance on a given task as they acquire 
	  	 more experience?” This can cover a wide array of technologies depending on 
	  	 what sort of task we have in mind, and what we take to constitute experience. 
	  	 Through this framing, we might view classical statistics problems, like 
	  	 estimating the likelihood that a coin lands on heads as an ML problem: the task 
	  	 is to produce an estimate, and the experience would consist of observations. 
	  	 But ML can also include robotics challenges, where the experience is acquired 
	  	 dynamically as our artificial agent interacts with the real world. Other grand 
	  	 challenges in machine learning relate to personalized medicine, materials 
	  	 discovery, and most recently generating media artifacts like images and text.</p>
	  	 
	  <p>This course is designed to give PhD students a solid foundation in the methods,
	  	 mathematics, and algorithms of modern machine learning. Students entering the 
	  	 class with a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics and 
	  	 algorithms will be at an advantage, but the class has been designed so that 
	  	 anyone with a strong mathematical and computer science background can catch up 
	  	 and fully participate. If you are interested in this topic, but are not a PhD 
	  	 student, or are a PhD student not specializing in machine learning, you might 
	  	 consider the master's level course on machine learning, 10-601. This class may 
	  	 be appropriate for MS and undergraduate students who are interested in the 
	  	 theory and algorithms behind machine learning.</p>
	     
	  <h5>Learning Outcomes</h5>
	  <p>By the end of the course, students should be able to:</p>

	  <ul>
	  	<li>Have a deep understanding of the assumptions, derivation and usage of some 
	  		of the most popular machine learning algorithms.</li>
	    <li>Implement and analyze existing learning algorithms, including well-studied 
	        methods for classification, regression, structured prediction, clustering, 
	        and representation learning.</li>
		<li>Integrate multiple facets of practical machine learning in a single system: 
		    data preprocessing, learning, regularization and model selection.</li>
		<li>Describe and derive the formal properties of models and algorithms for learning 
		    and explain the practical implications of those results.</li>
		<li>Compare and contrast different paradigms for learning (supervised, 
		    unsupervised, etc...).</li>
		<li>Design experiments to evaluate and compare different machine learning 
		    techniques on real-world problems.</li>
		<li>Employ probability, statistics, calculus, linear algebra, and optimization 
			in order to develop new predictive models or learning methods.</li>
		<li>Analyze the academic literature surrounding a recent area of research interest
			in machine learning, draw connections to historical works and identify 
			potential future lines of inquiry.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h3>2. Prerequisites</h3>
	  <p>Students entering the class are expected to have pre-existing working knowledge 
	     in the following areas:</p>
	     
	  <ol>
		<li><p>Significant experience <strong>programming</strong> in a general programming 
			language. Specifically, you need to have written from scratch programs 
			consisting of several hundred lines of code. For undergraduate students, 
			this will be satisfied for example by having passed 15-122 (Principles of 
			Imperative Computation) with a grade of ‘C’ or higher, or comparable courses 
			or experience elsewhere.</p>
			
			<p>Note: For the programming components of our homework assignments, you will 
			be required to use <strong>Python</strong>. You will be expected to know, or 
			be able to quickly pick up, that programming language.</p></li>
		<li>Basic familiarity with <strong>probability and statistics</strong>, as can be 
			achieved at CMU by having passed 36-217 (Probability Theory and Random Processes),  
			or 36-225 (Introduction to Probability and Statistics I), or 15-259, or 21-325, 
			or comparable courses elsewhere, with a grade of ‘C’ or higher.</li>
		<li>College-level maturity in <strong>discrete mathematics</strong>, as can be 
			achieved at CMU by having passed 21-127 (Concepts of Mathematics), 21-128 
			(Mathematical Concepts and Proofs), 15-151 (Mathematical Foundations for 
			Computer Science) or comparable courses elsewhere, with a grade of ‘C’ or 
			higher.</li>
		<li>College-level maturity in <strong>calculus and linear algebra</strong>, as 
			can be achieved at CMU by having passed 21-122 (Integration and Approximation), 
			21-241 (Matrix Algebra), 21-242 (Matrix Theory) or comparable courses elsewhere, 
			with a grade of ‘C’ or higher. </li>
	  </ol>
	  
	  <p>You must strictly adhere to these pre-requisites! Even if CMU’s registration 
	  	 system does not prevent you from registering for this course, it is still your
	  	 responsibility to make sure you have all of these prerequisites before you 
	  	 register.</p>
	  	 
	  <h3>3. Recommended Textbooks</h3>
	  <p>This course does not exactly follow any one textbook. However, most lectures 
	     will have some optional reading to help you better understand the material or 
	     see a different presentation/perspective. We recommend you read these after 
	     the corresponding lecture. These readings will typically be drawn from the 
	     following texts, many of which are freely available online:</p>
	     
	  <ul>
		<li><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf"

			Deep Learning</a>; Aston Zhang, Zack C. Lipton, Mu Li, Alex J. Smola.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>The textbook below is a great resource for those hoping to brush up on the 
	  	 prerequisite mathematics background for this course:</p>

	  <ul>
		<li><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
			Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>, Marc Peter Deisenroth, A. Aldo Faisal, 
			and Cheng Soon Ong.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>However, if you find yourself regularly and frequently referring to this textbook, 
	  	 we strongly encourage you to consider whether or not you have the necessary 
	  	 prerequisite knowledge to succeed in this course.</p>
	  	 
	  <h3>4. Assessments</h3>
	  <p>Your grade in this course will consist of participation in lectures, 
	  	 midterm and final exams, homework assignments and a class project. 
	  	 The breakdown is as follows:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
		<li>Participation = 5%</li>
		<li>Midterm = 25%</li>
		<li>Final = 25%</li>
		<li>6 Homework Assignments = 25%</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>HW1 - HW4 = 5% Each</li>
		  <li>HW5 - HW6 = 2.5% Each</li>
	    </ul>
		<li>Project = 20%</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>We will convert numerical course grades to letter grades based on grade 
	  	 boundaries that are determined at the end of the semester. The following is
	  	 a list of <strong>upper bounds</strong> on the grade cutoffs we will use;
	  	 in all likelihood, these will be adjusted down at the end of the semester:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
	  	<li>A+: ≥ 97%</li>
		<li>A: ≥ 93%</li>
		<li>A-: ≥ 90%</li>
		<li>B+: ≥ 87%</li>
		<li>B: ≥ 83%</li>
		<li>B-: ≥ 80%</li>
		<li>C+: ≥ 77%</li>
		<li>C: ≥ 73%</li>
		<li>C-: ≥ 70%</li>
		<li>D+: ≥ 67%</li>
		<li>D: ≥ 63%</li>	 
		<li>R: < 63%</li>
	  </ul>
	  	  	
	  <h5>Participation</h5>
	  <p>We will be using <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1073645" target="_blank" 
	  	 rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradescope</a> for in-class polls.</p>

	  <p>You will always be allowed to submit multiple times so if there are multiple 
	     questions during a lecture, you should submit multiple times. Your 
	     participation grade will be based on the percentage of in-class polls 
	     answered:</p>

	  <ul>
	  	<li>5% for 80% or greater poll participation.</li>
		<li>3% for 65%-80% poll participation.</li>
		<li>1% for 50%-65% poll participation.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>The correctness of your responses will not be taken into account when computing
	  	 participation grades, all that matters is that you submit something. <strong>All 
	  	 in-class polls will only be live until the start of the next lecture or recitation
	  	 </strong> (roughly a 48-hour period); you will receive 50% credit for any 
	  	 poll you respond to after the corresponding lecture ends, i.e., if you were to 
	  	 respond to every poll after the end of the corresponding lecture, then your 
	  	 overall participation grade would be 1%.</p>
	  	  
	  <h5>Midterm and Final Exams</h5>
	  <p>Unless otherwise noted, all exams for this course will be closed notes; you may 
	  	 bring one sheet of A4 paper as a cheatsheet (both back and front may be used). 
	  	 You are encouraged to handwrite this cheatsheet as a form of preparing for the 
	  	 exam but you may typeset them if you so choose.</p>

	  <p>The first exam will take place on Friday, October 31. The second exam will take place 
		 during the finals period and will be scheduled by the registrar. Please plan 
		 your travel accordingly as we will not be able accommodate individual travel 
		 needs (e.g., by offering the exam early). If you have an unavoidable conflict 
		 with either exam (e.g., an exam in another course), notify us by making a 
		 private post on <a href="https://piazza.com/class/mduh89mbr7g77s/" target="_blank" 
		 rel="noopener noreferrer">Piazza</a>.</p>
	  	  
	  <h5>Homework Assignments</h5>
	  <p>The homework assignments will be divided into two components: programming and 
	  	 written; most assignments will have both components but HW5 and HW6 will be 
	  	 written only assignments. The programming portions will ask you to implement 
	  	 machine learning algorithms from scratch; they emphasize understanding of 
	  	 real-world applications of machine learning, building end-to-end systems, and 
	  	 experimental design. The written portions will focus on core concepts, 
	  	 “on-paper” implementations of classic learning algorithms, derivations, and 
	  	 understanding of theory. All programming must be completed in Python.</p>
 
	  <h5>Project</h5>
	  <p>The course project is an opportunity for you to implement, explore and go beyond 
	     the methods presented in class applied to a real-world problem/research area. 
	     You will be given a small list of topics to choose from and will work in groups 
	     of 2 or 3; you may not work by yourself on the project.</p>

	  <p>There will be three deliverables associated with the project:</p>

	  <ul>
	  	<li>A one-page proposal detailing the topic your group will focus on, what method
	  		or methods you will implement, and the metrics you will use to compare them 
	  		(if applicable). Proposals will largely be graded on completion; their primary 
	  		purpose is for us to catch and correct any early misconceptions about the 
	  		project task/scope. The proposal is worth 2% of your final grade.</li>
		<li>A 2-3 page check-in describing the work done to date and any modifications to 
			the proposed plan as well as the rationale behind them. Check-ins should include 
			preliminary results and analysis. Again, these will largely be graded on 
			completion. The check-in is worth 2% of your final grade.</li>
		<li>An 8-page final report that describes the entirety of the work done for the 
			project. More details about what precisely is expected in the final reports 
			will be made available closer to the deadline. The final report is worth 16% 
			of your final grade.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>5. Office Hours</h3>
	  <p>The schedule of office hours will always appear on the <a href="index.html#Calendar">
	  	 course calendar</a>. In general, we will endeavor to hold a minimum of 6 office 
	  	 hours per week, with more in the week leading up to an exam.</p>
	  	 
	  <p>We will make use of the following (informal) rules:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>10 Minute Rule:</strong> Each student’s question will be addressed 
	    	by a course staff member for at most 10 minutes. The only exception to this 
	    	will be if the question has broad interest to many other students.</li>
		<li><strong>The Pseudo Code Rule:</strong> This is not a programming course; 
			you are expected to know how to debug code. As such, if your question is of 
			the form "Could you help me to debug my code?", you must bring with you 
			detailed pseudocode that describes your implementation design. If you do not 
			have pseudocode, the course staff member will not look at your code, but 
			instead ask you to sketch out pseudocode at the chalkboard and discuss there 
			instead. After discussing at a high-level, if your 10 minutes have not expired, 
			the course staff member may have time to look at your code.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>While you're awaiting your turn, we encourage you to listen in to the answers 
	  	 to any publicly answered questions. Please be courteous and allow the student 
	  	 who posed the question to primarily direct the discussion. We also encourage 
	  	 you to collaborate with others (following our collaboration policies below) 
	  	 while waiting.</p>
	  
	  <h3>6. General Policies</h3>
	  <h5>Late homework policy</h5>
	  <p>You have a total of 6 grace days for use on any homework assignment. We will 
	     automatically keep a tally of these grace days for you; they will be applied 
	     greedily. You may not use more than 2 grace days on any single assignment. 
	     Submitting a homework late when you are out of grace days will result in the 
	     following penalties:</p>

	  <ul>
	  	<li>Submissions between 0 and 24 hours late will receive a 50% multiplicative penalty.</li>
		<li>Submissions between 24 and 48 hours late will receive a 25% multiplicative penalty.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>Any homework submitted more than 48 hours late will receive a score of 0. Grace 
	  days may not be applied to any of the project deliverables.</p>
	  
	  <h5>Extensions</h5>
	  <p>In general, we do not grant extensions on assignments. There are several 
	     exceptions:</p>
	  
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>Medical Emergencies:</strong> If you are sick and unable to complete 
	    	an assignment or attend class, please go to University Health Services. 
	    	For minor illnesses, we expect grace days or our late penalties to provide 
	    	sufficient accommodation. For medical emergencies (e.g., prolonged 
	    	hospitalization), students may request an extension afterwards.</li>
		<li><strong>Family/Personal Emergencies:</strong> If you have a family emergency 
			(e.g., death in the family) or a personal emergency (e.g., mental health 
			crisis), please contact your academic adviser and/or Counseling and 
			Psychological Services (CaPS).</li>
		<li><strong>University-Approved Travel:</strong> If you are traveling out-of-town 
			to a university approved event or an academic conference, you may request an 
			extension for any time lost due to traveling. For university approved 
			absences, you must provide confirmation of attendance, usually from a 
			faculty or staff organizer of the event or via travel/conference receipts.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>For any of the above situations, you may request an extension by emailing Jacob
	  	 at <a href="mailto:jrast@andrew.cmu.edu">jrast@andrew.cmu.edu</a> – 
	  	 <strong>do not email the instructor or TAs.</strong> Please be specific about 
	  	 which assessment(s) you are requesting an extension for and the number of hours 
	  	 requested. The email should be sent as soon as you are aware of the conflict
	  	 and at least 24 hours prior to the deadline. In the case of an emergency, 
	  	 no notice is needed.</p>

	  <p>If this is a medical emergency or mental health crisis, you must also CC your 
	     CMU college liaison and/or your academic advisor. Do not submit any medical 
	     documentation to the course staff. If necessary, your college liaison and 
	     The Division of Student Affairs (DoSA) will request such documentation and 
	     they will view the health documentation and conclude whether a retroactive 
	     extension is appropriate. If you haven’t interacted with your college liaison 
	     before, they are experienced student affairs staff who work in partnership 
	     with students, housefellows, advisors, faculty, and associate deans in each 
	     college to assure support for students regarding their overall Carnegie Mellon 
	     experience.</p>

	  <h5>Audit Policy</h5>
	  <p>Formal auditing of this course is permitted. You must follow the official 
	     procedures for a course audit as outlined by the HUB/registrar. Please do not 
	     email the instructor requesting permission to audit. Instead, you should first 
	     register for the appropriate section. Next fill out the 
	     <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/hub/docs/course-audit.pdf" target="_blank" 
	     rel="noopener noreferrer">Course Audit Approval form</a>, obtain your academic 
	     advisor's signature and then approach the instructor in-person immediately 
	     after lecture to obtain their signature.</p>

	  <p>Auditors are required to:</p>

	  <ul>
		<li>Attend or watch all of the lectures.</li>
		<li>Receive a 65% participation grade or higher.</li>
		<li>Submit at least 4 of the 6 homework assignments.</li>
		<li>Auditors are encouraged to sit for the exams, but should only do so if 
			they plan to put forth actual effort in solving them.</li>
		<li>Auditors should not complete a course project unless they clearly 
			communicate their status as an auditor to their group members and all other
			group members agree to work with them.</li>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <h5>Pass/Fail Policy</h5>
	  <p>You are allowed to take this course as Pass/Fail; instructor permission is not 
	     required. What letter grade is the cutoff for a Pass will depend on your 
	     specific program; we do not specify whether or not you Pass but rather we 
	     compute your letter grade the same as everyone else in the class and your 
	     program converts that letter grade to a Pass or Fail depending on their 
	     cutoff. Be sure to check with your program/department as to whether you can 
	     count a Pass/Fail course towards your degree requirements.</p>

	  <h5>Accommodations for Students with Disabilities</h5>
	  <p>If you have a disability and have an accommodations letter from the Disability 
	     Resources office, please email Jacob at <a href="mailto:jrast@andrew.cmu.edu">
	     jrast@andrew.cmu.edu</a> to set up a meeting for the purposes of discussing 
	     your accommodations and needs as early in the semester as possible. He will 
	     work with you to ensure that accommodations are provided as appropriate. If you 
	     suspect that you may have a disability and would benefit from accommodations 
	     but are not yet registered with the Office of Disability Resources, I encourage 
	     you to contact them at <a href="mailto:access@andrew.cmu.edu">
	     access@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>

	  <h3>7. Technologies</h3>
	  <p>We will use a variety of technologies throughout the course:</p>

	  <ul>
	    <li><a href="https://piazza.com/class/mduh89mbr7g77s/" target="_blank" 
	    	rel="noopener noreferrer">Piazza</a>: we will use Piazza for all course discussion. 
	    	Questions about homeworks, course content, logistics, etc. should all be 
	    	directed to Piazza. If you have a question, chances are several others had the 
	    	same question. By posting your question publicly, the course staff can answer 
	    	once and everyone benefits. If you have a private question, you should also 
	    	use Piazza as it will likely receive a faster response.</li>
		<li><p><a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/1073645" target="_blank" 
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Gradescope</a>: we will use Gradescope to collect PDF 
			submissions of the homework assignments as well as any code you write to complete
			the assignments. The course staff will grade your submissions, and you’ll receive 
			personalized feedback explaining the grades you receive.</p>
			
			<p>If you believe an error was made during grading, you will be able to submit 
			a regrade request on Gradescope. For each homework assignment, regrade requests 
			will be open for only 1 week after the grades have been published. This is to 
			encourage you to check the feedback you’ve received early!</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms" target="_blank" 
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Forms</a>: we will use Google Forms to collect 
			feedback and responses to polls during lecture. These polls will be hosted on 
			Google Forms.</p></li>
		<li><p><a href="https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=cc2bc5c0-ecd9-46b8-98db-b341012e3f06" target="_blank" 
			rel="noopener noreferrer">Panopto</a>: Lecture recordings can be found on Panopto</p></li>
	  </ul>	

	  <h3>8. Collaboration and Academic Integrity</h3>
	  <h4>Read this section carefully!</h4>

	  <h5>Collaboration among Students</h5>
	  <p>The purpose of student collaboration is to facilitate learning, not to 
	     circumvent it. Studying the material in groups is strongly encouraged. You are 
	     also allowed to seek help from other students in understanding the material 
	     needed to solve a particular homework problem, provided any written notes 
	     (including code) are taken on an impermanent surface (e.g., whiteboard, 
	     chalkboard), and provided learning is facilitated, not circumvented. The actual 
	     solution must be written by each student alone.</p>
	     
	  <p>A good method to follow when collaborating is to meet with your peers, discuss 
	     ideas at a high level, but do not copy down any notes from each other or from 
	     a shared work surface. Any scratch work done at this time should be your own only. 
	     Before writing the assignment solutions, you should make sure that you are 
	     doing this without anyone else present, putting all notes away, closing all 
	     tabs on your computer, and writing it completely by yourself with no other 
	     resources.</p>
	     
	  <p>You are absolutely not allowed to share/compare answers or screen share your 
	     work with one another.</p>

	  <p>The presence or absence of any form of help or collaboration, whether given 
	     or received, must be explicitly stated and disclosed in full by all involved. 
	     Specifically, each assignment solution must include answers to the following 
	     questions:</p>
	     
	  <ol>
		<li>Did you receive any help whatsoever from anyone in solving this assignment? 
			Yes / No.</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>If you answered ‘yes’, give full details: ____________</li>
		  <li>(e.g., "Jane Doe explained to me what is asked in Question 3.4")</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Did you give any help whatsoever to anyone in solving this assignment? 
			Yes / No.</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>If you answered ‘yes’, give full details: _____________</li>
		  <li>(e.g., "I pointed Joe Smith to section 2.3 since he didn’t know how to 
		  	  proceed with Question 2")</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Did you find or come across code that implements any part of this assignment?
			Yes / No. (See below policy on "found code")</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>If you answered ‘yes’, give full details: _____________</li>
		  <li>(book & page, URL & location within the page, etc.).</li>
	  </ol>
	  
	  <p>If you gave help after turning in your own assignment and/or after answering 
	  	 the questions above, you must update your answers before the assignment’s 
	  	 deadline, if necessary by emailing the course staff.</p>

	  <p><strong>Collaboration without full disclosure will be handled severely, in 
	     compliance with CMU’s Policy on <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html" 
	     target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academic Integrity</a>.</strong></p>
	     
	  <h5>Previously Used Assignments</h5>
	  <p>Some of the homework assignments used in this class may have been used in prior 
	  	 offerings, in classes at other institutions, or elsewhere. Solutions to them 
	  	 may be, or may have been, available online, or from other people or sources. 
	  	 It is explicitly forbidden to use any such sources, or to consult people who 
	  	 have solved these problems before. It is explicitly forbidden to search for 
	  	 these problems or their solutions on the internet. You must complete the homework
	  	 assignments completely on your own. We will be actively monitoring your 
	  	 compliance. Collaboration with other students who are currently taking the class 
	  	 is allowed, but only under the conditions stated above.</p>
	  	 
	  <h5>AI Assistance</h5>
	  <p>To best support your own learning, you should complete all graded assignments in 
	     this course yourself, without any use of generative artificial intelligence (AI), 
	     such as ChatGPT. Please refrain from using AI tools to generate any content (text, 
	     video, audio, images, code, etc.) for an assessment. Passing off any AI generated 
	     content as your own (e.g., cutting and pasting content into written assignments, or 
	     paraphrasing AI content) constitutes a violation of CMU’s Policy on <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/policies/student-and-student-life/academic-integrity.html" 
	     target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Academic Integrity</a>.</p>
	  
	  <h5>Policy Regarding "Found Code"</h5>
	  <p>You are encouraged to read books and other instructional materials, both online 
	     and offline, to help you understand the concepts and algorithms taught in class. 
	     These materials may contain example code or pseudocode, which may help you 
	     better understand an algorithm or an implementation detail. However, when you 
	     implement your own solution to an assignment, you must put all materials aside, 
	     and write your code completely on your own, starting "from scratch". 
	     Specifically, you may not use any code you found or came across. If you find 
	     or come across code that implements any part of your assignment, you must 
	     disclose this fact in your collaboration statement.</p>

	  <h5>Duty to Protect One’s Work</h5>
	  <p>Students are responsible for proactively protecting their work from copying 
	     and misuse by other students. If a student’s work is copied by another student, 
	     the original author is also considered to be in violation of the course 
	     policies. It does not matter whether the author allowed the work to be copied 
	     or was merely negligent in preventing it from being copied. When overlapping 
	     work is submitted by different students, both students will be punished.</p>

	  <p>To protect future students, do not post your solutions publicly, neither during 
	  	 the course nor afterwards.</p>

	  <h5>Penalties for Violations of Course Policies</h5>
	  <p>All violations of course policies (even the first one) will always be reported 
	     to the university authorities (your department head, associate dean, the dean of 
	     Student Affairs, etc.) as an official Academic Integrity Violation and will 
	     carry severe penalties.</p>

	  <ol>
	    <li>The penalty for the first violation is a negative 100% on the assignment i.e., 
	        it would have been better to submit nothing and receive a 0%.</li>
		<li>The penalty for the second violation is failure in the course, and can even 
			lead to dismissal from the university.</li>
	  </ol>
	  
	  <h3>9. Support</h3>
	  <p>Take care of yourself. Do your best to maintain a healthy lifestyle by eating 
	     well, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, getting enough sleep and taking 
	     some time to relax. This will help you achieve your goals and cope with stress.</p>

	  <p>All of us benefit from support during times of struggle. You are not alone. 
	     There are many helpful resources available on campus and an important part of 
	     the college experience is learning how to ask for help. Asking for support 
	     sooner rather than later is often helpful.</p>

	  <p>If you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life 
	     events, or feelings like anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to 
	     seek support. Counseling and Psychological Services (CaPS) is here to help: 
	     call 412-268-2922 and visit their website at 
	     <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
	     http://www.cmu.edu/counseling/</a>.</p>

	  <p>If you or someone you know is feeling suicidal or in danger of self-harm, call 
	     someone immediately, day or night:</p>
	
	  <ul>
	  	<li>CaPS: 412-268-2922</li>
		<li>Re:solve Crisis Network: 888-796-8226</li>
		<li>If the situation is life threatening, call the police:</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>On campus: CMU Police: 412-268-2323</li>
		  <li>Off campus: 911</li>
		</ul>
	  </ul>

	  <h3>10. Diversity</h3>
	  <p>We must treat every individual with respect. We are diverse in many ways, and 
	     this diversity is fundamental to building and maintaining an equitable and 
	     inclusive campus community. Diversity can refer to multiple ways that we 
	     identify ourselves, including but not limited to race, color, national origin, 
	     language, sex, disability, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, religion, 
	     creed, ancestry, belief, veteran status, or genetic information. Each of these 
	     diverse identities, along with many others not mentioned here, shape the 
	     perspectives our students, faculty, and staff bring to our campus. We, at CMU, 
	     will work to promote diversity, equity and inclusion not only because diversity 
	     fuels excellence and innovation, but because we want to pursue justice. We 
	     acknowledge our imperfections while we also fully commit to the work, inside 
	     and outside of our classrooms, of building and sustaining a campus community 
	     that increasingly embraces these core values.</p>

	  <p>Each of us is responsible for creating a safer, more inclusive environment.</p>

	  <p>Unfortunately, incidents of bias or discrimination do occur, whether intentional 
	     or unintentional. They contribute to creating an unwelcoming environment for 
	     individuals and groups at the university. Therefore, the university encourages 
	     anyone who experiences or observes unfair or hostile treatment on the basis of 
	     identity to speak out for justice and support, within the moment of the incident 
	     or after the incident has passed. Anyone can share these experiences using the 
	     following resources:</p>
	
	  <ul>
		<li>Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion: <a href="mailto:csdi@andrew.cmu.edu">
			csdi@andrew.cmu.edu</a>, 412-268-2150</li>
		<li>Ethics Reporting Hotline. Students, faculty, and staff can anonymously file a 
			report by calling 844-587-0793 or visiting <a href="http://cmu.ethicspoint.com" 
			target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cmu.ethicspoint.com</a>.</li>
		<ul>
		  <li>username: tartans</li>
		  <li>password: plaid</li>
		</ul>
	  </ul>
	  
	  <p>All reports will be documented and deliberated to determine if there should be 
	     any following actions. Regardless of incident type, the university will use all 
	     shared experiences to transform our campus climate to be more equitable and 
	     just.</p>
